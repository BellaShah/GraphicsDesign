PART I: 
To run the python script, navigate to the folder in terminal and type “python3 extract_words.py [book.txt]” where [book.txt] is any text file you’d like (must be in the same folder as extract_words.py). 
This assignment has Alice in Wonderland pre-loaded into it— but it can be changed. 


The python script gives the following files, but requires them to be moved.
letterfrequency.txt -> a3_letterfrequency
	
wordfrequency.txt   -> a3_wordfrequency
	uniquewords.txt	    -> a3_novelvisualization

NOTE: the zipped folder already has the respective text files in them; 
the above guide is if you want to change the text file (i.e.: use a different book).


To run novel visualization, navigate to a3_novelvisualization. Run the .pde file. 

To run word frequency, navigate to a3_wordfrequency. Run the .pde file. 

To run letter frequency, navigate to a3_letter frequency. Run the .pde file.
