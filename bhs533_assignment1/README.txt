Instructions:
To run the code, open the file bhs533_assignment1 in processing.
Next, press play and view the static image.

Description:
The static image is a depiction of a boat on the ocean 
with other elements such as the sun, birds and the UT logo.
For the sun, I used a simple ellipse and multi-colored lines
as the rays. The ocean was created using repeated Bezier curves
and the below the curve is a rectangle filled with the same blue
color. The birds were made using the curveVertex() function
which allowed me to specify points to ensure a smooth curve.
The boat was made using the arc() function to acheive the half
circle. Text was used to create the "UT" logo.
