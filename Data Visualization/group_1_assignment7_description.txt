Part one of this assignment is a line graph displaying the number of arrests in Los Angeles between 2006 and 2015. 

Part two of this assignment is a bar graph with clickable functionality that visualizes arrests in Los Angeles between 2006 and 2005 bases on gender, race, and age groups. When you press 1, 2, and 3 the bar graphs toggle between the three parameters. The bars change colors to show the ratios of each parameter. There is also a key included to show which color corresponds to which segment of each parameter. For example, orange for male and teal for female. 

Part three is an RSS reader that parses XML files from BBC. There are 5 different categories: UK, UK Politics, World, Business, and Science. Hovering over the story gives a short description of the story and clicking the story opens it in a browser window. Use the arrow keys on the side of the screen to scroll though RSS feed. Use the buttons on the side of the screen to select different channels.
